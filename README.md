Bubble Sort Program in C

This is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C language. Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o bubble_sort bubble_sort.c
To run the compiled program, use:

bash
Copy code
./bubble_sort
Algorithm Overview

Start with an unsorted array of elements.
Repeat the following steps until no more swaps are needed:
Compare adjacent elements in the array.
If they are in the wrong order, swap them.
Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.
Input Format

The program prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the array and then asks for the elements one by one.

Output Format

After sorting the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm, the program prints the sorted array.

Sample Usage

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 23
Enter element 2: 12
Enter element 3: 56
Enter element 4: 8
Enter element 5: 43

Unsorted array: 23 12 56 8 43
Array after Bubble Sort: 8 12 23 43 56
Implementation Notes

The program uses a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm and is suitable for small arrays.
For larger arrays or performance-critical applications, more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort should be considered.
Feel free to modify and expand upon this program as needed for your specific requirements. Happy coding!
