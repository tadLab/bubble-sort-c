BUBBLE SORT PROGRAM IN C : 

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements of the list. If they are in the wrong order (i.e., the first element is greater than the second), swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat step 2.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list. At this point, the largest element will have "bubbled" to the end of the list.
5. Repeat steps 1-4, but ignore the last element of the list (since it's already in its correct position after the previous pass).
6. Continue this process, each time ignoring one more element from the end of the list, until the entire list is sorted.
